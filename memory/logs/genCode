The functioning of this application is straightforward, it just needs to print the message \"Hello World\" on the console.\n\nProgram Features:\n\nOur \"Hello World\" console application will only have a single feature - the delivery of the string \"Hello World\" to the system console. \n\nProgram Structure:\n\nGiven the simplicity of a \"Hello World\" program, we don't require any specific classes other than the default \"Program\" class automatically generated by the .NET framework for console applications.\n\nHowever, we will make use of the following methods:\n\n1. Main method - the entry point of our Console application. The Main method will call a WriteLine method from the System.Console class, which will print the message \"Hello World\" on the console.\n\nDependencies:\n\nStandard dependencies include the .NET Core Framework which provides the necessary environment to build and run C# applications, and the System namespace, which provides access to fundamental classes and base types that defines commonly-used values and reference data types, events and event handlers, interfaces, attributes, and exception handling.\n\nSpecification:\n\n```\npublic class Program // This class encapsulates the entire console application\n{\n     public static void Main(string[] args) // This method is the main entry point of the application\n     {\n          System.Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\"); // This line of code prints \"Hello World\" to the console.\n     }\n}\n```\n\nThe WriteLine method is a part of the System.Console class and is used to print text on the console. In our case, this text is \"Hello World\". The \"static\" keyword indicates that the Main method can be called without an instance of the Program class. The Main method itself is encapsulated within a class called \"Program\".\n\nThere are no non-standard dependencies. In this project, we are only using basic functionalities provided by the .NET Core Framework, which includes the ability to print output to the console."},{"role":"user","content":"Unit tests:\n\nTo properly simulate a Console application behavior and be able to test the output to the standard output, we could redirect the `Console.Out` to a `StringWriter`. Doing so, after invoking the `Main` method we would be able to validate the data that was written to the console output.\n\nFor the sake of this testing, I'll be assuming that the `Main` method of the `Program` class would be placed in a file called `Program.cs` and the test cases will be written in a separate file named `ProgramTests.cs`.\n\nProgram.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class Program // This class encapsulates the entire console application\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args) // This method is the main entry point of the application\n    {\n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\"); // This line of code prints \"Hello World\" to the console.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nProgramTests.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing NUnit.Framework;\n\n[TestFixture]\npublic class ProgramTests\n{\n    private StringWriter stringWriter;\n\n    [SetUp]\n    public void SetUp()\n    {\n        stringWriter = new StringWriter();\n        Console.SetOut(stringWriter);\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Main_PrintsHelloWorld()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        string expected = \"Hello World\" + Environment.NewLine;\n\n        // Act\n        Program.Main(new string[] { });\n\n        // Assert\n        Assert.AreEqual(expected, stringWriter.GetStringBuilder().ToString());\n    }\n\n    [TearDown]\n    public void TearDown()\n    {\n        stringWriter.Close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere, we have a `SetUp` method that is run before each test to redirect the `Console.Out` to our `StringWriter` and a `TearDown` method to release the resources after each test. The `Main_PrintsHelloWorld` method is our test case which asserts, that after invoking the `Main` method, our `StringWriter` contains the expected output."},{"role":"user","content":"Please now remember the steps:\n\nThink step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.\nFirst lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\n\nThen you will output the content of each file including ALL code.\nEach file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that\n[FILENAME] is the lowercase file name including the file extension,\n[LANG] is the markup code block language for the code's language, and [CODE] is the code:\n\nSyntax:\n[FILENAME]\n```[LANG]\n[CODE]\n```\n\nPlease note that the code should be fully functional.

In this simple case it just writes \"Hello World\" to the console output.\n\n`Main` Method - Entry point for the application. It's called when the application is started. Invokes the Console.WriteLine method to output \"Hello World\".\n\n`ProgramTests` Class - Holds the unit tests for the main program.\n\n`SetUp` Method - Prepares the environment for the testing by redirecting the standard output to a string, which can be analyzed later.\n\n`TearDown` Method - Cleans up the environment after each test.\n\n`Main_PrintsHelloWorld` Method - Test method that verifies if the \"Hello World\" string is properly outputted to the console.\n\nNow, let's implement the code in files:\n\nProgram.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    public static void Main(string[] args)\n    {\n        System.Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nProgramTests.cs\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing NUnit.Framework;\n\n[TestFixture]\npublic class ProgramTests\n{\n    private StringWriter stringWriter;\n\n    [SetUp]\n    public void SetUp()\n    {\n        stringWriter = new StringWriter();\n        Console.SetOut(stringWriter);\n    }\n\n    [Test]\n    public void Main_PrintsHelloWorld()\n    {\n        // Arrange\n        string expected = \"Hello World\" + Environment.NewLine;\n\n        // Act\n        Program.Main(new string[] { });\n\n        // Assert\n        Assert.AreEqual(expected, stringWriter.GetStringBuilder().ToString());\n    }\n\n    [TearDown]\n    public void TearDown()\n    {\n        stringWriter.Close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese are all the necessary pieces of code for the \"Hello World\" Console application in C#, as well as its unit tests.\n\nAll parts of the architecture are in the files. The `Program.cs` contains the main application logic and the `ProgramTests.cs` contains the unit tests that validate this logic."}]
