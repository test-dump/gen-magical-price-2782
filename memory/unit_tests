To properly simulate a Console application behavior and be able to test the output to the standard output, we could redirect the `Console.Out` to a `StringWriter`. Doing so, after invoking the `Main` method we would be able to validate the data that was written to the console output.

For the sake of this testing, I'll be assuming that the `Main` method of the `Program` class would be placed in a file called `Program.cs` and the test cases will be written in a separate file named `ProgramTests.cs`.

Program.cs
```csharp
using System;

public class Program // This class encapsulates the entire console application
{
    public static void Main(string[] args) // This method is the main entry point of the application
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World"); // This line of code prints "Hello World" to the console.
    }
}
```

ProgramTests.cs
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using NUnit.Framework;

[TestFixture]
public class ProgramTests
{
    private StringWriter stringWriter;

    [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        stringWriter = new StringWriter();
        Console.SetOut(stringWriter);
    }

    [Test]
    public void Main_PrintsHelloWorld()
    {
        // Arrange
        string expected = "Hello World" + Environment.NewLine;

        // Act
        Program.Main(new string[] { });

        // Assert
        Assert.AreEqual(expected, stringWriter.GetStringBuilder().ToString());
    }

    [TearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
        stringWriter.Close();
    }
}
```

Here, we have a `SetUp` method that is run before each test to redirect the `Console.Out` to our `StringWriter` and a `TearDown` method to release the resources after each test. The `Main_PrintsHelloWorld` method is our test case which asserts, that after invoking the `Main` method, our `StringWriter` contains the expected output.
