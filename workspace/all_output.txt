The provided code seems to be correct without any syntax errors or bugs for a simple console application. It prints a "Hello World" when run and includes a test to check if the "Hello World" message is being printed correctly. If there are specific requirements or behaviors that the code isn't adhering to, please provide them.

However, standard best practice is to include "using" statements for utilized libraries at the top of the files. While not strictly necessary in these specific codes, it is good programming practice. So, updated version of the code with explicit "using" statements would look like this:

Program.cs
```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public static class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
```

ProgramTests.cs
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using NUnit.Framework;
using HelloWorld;

namespace HelloWorld.Tests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class ProgramTests
    {
        private StringWriter stringWriter;

        [SetUp]
        public void SetUp()
        {
            stringWriter = new StringWriter();
            Console.SetOut(stringWriter);
        }

        [Test]
        public void Main_PrintsHelloWorld()
        {
            // Arrange
            string expected = "Hello World" + Environment.NewLine;

            // Act
            Program.Main(new string[] { });

            // Assert
            Assert.AreEqual(expected, stringWriter.GetStringBuilder().ToString());
        }

        [TearDown]
        public void TearDown()
        {
            stringWriter.Close();
        }
    }
}
```
This code is more modular and follows standard best practices. Remember to include the NUnit Testing package in your project to be able to use the Fixture and Test attributes, SetUp and TearDown Methods, and Assert Class.
